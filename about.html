    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I've always had an interest in tech and computers, I was raised 
      by a computer-savvy father, he was always building or repairing 
      computers and tried to share his love for it with me, however being
       from the generation when the internet really took off I was always
        drawn to software and web development. After having my daughter I
         enrolled in a free open university course on web design but it just 
         was not right for me as it focused more on the style of the site than
          building it. I dabbled in web design off and on over the years, 
          helping out friends, family and acquaintances with their websites. 
          It's only now that my daughter is all grown up that I decided to pursue
           my dream of getting into the world of software development and so 
           my journey began in the summer of 2022. I am currently working my 
           way through the codecademy full stack engineer course and it's fascinating to see how different yet similar coding languages are, I'm excited at the prospect of learning the next new (to me) thing!</p>
